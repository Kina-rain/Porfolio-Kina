      <p> Hi, my name is Tina Lawrence. I have lived in Maryland for most of my life; even though, I have friends and family all over the world and have visited many places in Europe and Asia. I have been a Refistereed Nurse for over 20 years. 
        After graduating from the University of Maryland at Baltimore with a BSN, I obtained my RN licensure and traveled with my husband to Hawaii to work at Tripler Army hospital in the Ob/ Gyn Department. There I worked with a variety of 
        patients from general gynecology issues to education obstetric patients on preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.</p>
      <p>After my husband's tour of duty in Hawaii, we returned to Maryland and I began working in Dialysis. My job requested that I help out the Towson Clinic, so I became the Director of Nursing for a Dialysis center/ nursing home. After 
        reorganizing the clinic and education the staff on protocols and procedures, I wanted to return closer to home and found a job at a local Johns Hopkins clinic maintaining anticoagulation therapy for patients and doing emergency triage 
        for the clinic.</p>
      <p>Through my nursing experience I have found myself working more and more on computers, so with support from family and friends, I have decided to take a huge leap into the computer industry and began a program at Johns Hopkins to 
        become a full stack web developer.</p>
